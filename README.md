## Overview

**REAPER** is a powerful and flexible web-based GM toolset designed to streamline
your tabletop RPG campaigns. It helps Dungeon Masters and game masters effortlessly
manage player characters, narrative scenes, combat encounters, and DM notes ‚Äî all in
one place. Built with React, Zustand, and a Node.js backend, REAPER brings modern
convenience to classic pen-and-paper adventures.

## Features

- **Campaign Dashboard:** Track player characters, NPCs, stats, and hit points with
  easy-to-read interfaces.  
- **Scene Manager:** Organize scenes, assign maps extracted directly from your
  campaign PDFs, and keep DM notes tied to narrative moments.  
- **Combat Tracker:** Manage initiative, conditions, and combat notes for dynamic
  battle management.  
- **DM Module:** Centralize campaign and scene notes, upload chapter PDFs for map
  extraction, and export your session data as JSON backups.  
- **Map Extraction:** Upload your official PDFs, automatically extract maps, and
  assign them to scenes for quick reference.

  to extend cloud sync.
